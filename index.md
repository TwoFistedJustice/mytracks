Hi there! My name is Chris and I like to explore dirt roads on my [dual-sport
motorcycle](https://www.instagram.com/p/BCvKexQntIp/). Each time I return from
an adventure, I share my [tracks]({{ base_path }}/map.html) and [notes]({{
base_path }}/notes) to make it easier for you to get out there and **start your
own adventure**.

Please [get in touch]({{ base_path }}/contact) if you have any questions or
just want to say hello.

title: "Santa Barbara to Monterey"

This was an easy ride up the coast from Santa Barbara to Monterey, California.
Highway 1 is pretty nice, but I really liked getting off the pavement for a bit
on Los Burros Road and again up Coast Road by Big Sur. I've been on both of
these roads before, but never on the smaller WR250R.

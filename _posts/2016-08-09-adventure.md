Adventure.
It's what drives us to explore the unknown.
What enriches our lives with the colorful experiences,
that we share with our friends at home.

That fear you feel, it's real, but don't hate it.
It's those magical moments you overcome it that you've made it.
A memory worth sharing, a story worth living,
if you can conquer those fears, then my friend you are winning.

So think about those things. The things that you fear.
Lack of money? Lack of planning? Lack of friends to carry your beer?
And plan an adventure that you can start tomorrow.
Conquer one of those fears and make some tracks that I can borrow.

You've got some amazing stuff right out your door.
Share it with others and encourage them to explore.

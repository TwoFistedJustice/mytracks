Easy gravel/dirt day ride with Jerry over to Vernonia, Oregon. We started at
[Two Stroke Coffee](http://www.2strokecoffee.com/) and stopped for lunch at
[The Black Iron Grill](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-black-iron-grill-vernonia).
This route was covered in snow for a couple months, but it's all puddles now.

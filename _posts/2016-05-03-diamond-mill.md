This was my first ride in the [Diamond Mill
OHV](http://www.riderplanet-usa.com/atv/trails/info/oregon_01858/ride_ff23.htm)
area. Lots of rocks and definitely at the upper end of my skill level. I was
hoping to find trails all the way up to Triangulation Point, but ran into a
downed tree (figuratively and literally). This is part of the route that I plan
to ride with [Spencer](https://www.instagram.com/thegeardude690/) when he comes
down to visit Oregon. I finished the ride at [See See Motor
Coffee](http://www.seeseemotorcycles.com/) to show off my dirty bike.

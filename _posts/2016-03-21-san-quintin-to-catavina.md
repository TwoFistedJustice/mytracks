Today we left San Quintin and rode South to Catavina with [High Desert
Adventures](http://www.highdesertadventures.net/). The amazing [Alfonso Alonzo
Diaz](https://www.facebook.com/DIESPRO) led the way. This was a very
challenging day for me, but I started to enjoy it after I stopped swearing in
my helmet. Lots of deep sand, rocks, and cactus (one of which broke my hand).
